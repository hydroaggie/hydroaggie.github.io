Collins is a MS student at the Utah Water Research Laboratory, Utah State University. Collins's research is focused on the effect that canal seepage has on subsurface hydrological and thermal processes near Hyrum, Utah. Collins is also working on numerical modeling of the canal-shallow aquifer-river system to further study the affect of changing canal seepage inputs on the subsurface hydrological and thermal processes in this system.
