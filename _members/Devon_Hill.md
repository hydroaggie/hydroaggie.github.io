Devon Hill is a PhD student at the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University. His research focuses on surface-subsurface hydrologic connectivity and reactive transport dynamics across the hillslope–riparian zone–river corridor continuum in cold, high-latitude watersheds. A major component of his work involves adapting and calibrating hydrologic and transport models using data from the Imnavait Creek watershed in Alaska. Ultimately, he aims to implement a 3D watershed model using ATS and integrate novel instream processes to enhance hydrologic simulations.

## Short Bio

Devon earned both his BS and MS degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Utah State University. Research for his MS degree focused on surface and groundwater interaction in mountainous karst. He began his PhD studies at USU in 2024. His MS and PhD research have each included their share of field work and modeling. Outside of research, he enjoys running, roller skating, and wakeboarding.
