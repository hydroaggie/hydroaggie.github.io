I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University. My research focuses on improving subsurface parameterization using ML approach, and I am currently working on the NOAA-funded [CIROH project](/projects/CIROH_lowflow) to improve catchment subsurface parameter estimation at the hydrofabric scale across CONUS.

## Short Bio

I received my B.S./B.Tech and M.S./M.Tech degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering and Geo-Informatics, respectively, from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur), India. I completed my Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), USA, and began my postdoctoral fellowship at Utah State University (USU) in 2025.
