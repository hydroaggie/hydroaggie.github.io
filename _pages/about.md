Welcome to the Shuai Computational and Integrated Hydrology (**SCI-Hy**) group, led by [Pin Shuai](/members/Pin_Shuai), at Utah State University! We are passionate about exploring the complex and dynamic hydrological system using novel techniques. Our research endeavors are driven by a commitment to advancing scientific knowledge, fostering innovation, and addressing pressing environmental challenges. 

Our research interests lie in the following areas: 1) understanding of the **hydrological, biogeochemical processes** occurring at the aquatic‐terrestrial interface under the impact of **groundwater and surface water interactions**; 2) quantifying the **flow and transport of heat, nutrients and contaminants from bedrock to canopy top in a watershed**, and feedbacks between hydrology, land use, and climate change; and 3) understanding the complex **human-water interactions**. We focus on answering the following questions: Where does groundwater come from? How does groundwater interact with surface water? What are the impacts of disturbances (e.g., drought and landcover change) on watershed hydro-biogeochemical processes.

We apply a model‐data integrative approach which combines **field**, **laboratory**, and **remote sensing** techniques with **numerical models** leveraging the power of **high‐performance computing** to improve understanding of hydrological processes. We are strong advocates for **open source** and **reproducible** scientific research. For current and past projects, see [Projects](/projects) page for more information.

We are always looking for passionate and talented group members. Visit [Prospective Students](/prospective_students) page for more information.
