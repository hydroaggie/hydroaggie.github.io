    Project overview. Water management infrastructure includes reservoirs, agricultural and domestic water use.

Human activities such as water diversion, reservoir management, and irrigation significantly impact streamflow. While water management models (WMMs) address these aspects, they are not seamlessly integrated with hydrologic models. This project aims to bridge this gap by enhancing the existing national hydrologic geospatial fabric (hydrofabric) and creating data and tools for coupling WMMs with hydrologic models. The project has two main objectives: (1) to extend the hydrofabric to include water management infrastructure and water use data for coupling WMMs and hydrologic models, and (2) to demonstrate the applicability of this extension by coupling a WMM (e.g., MODSIM) with USGS Enterprise Capacity (EC) models in selected managed watersheds. The overarching expected contribution is to identify a roadmap, requirements, and challenges for coupling WMMs and hydrologic models nationwide. The research plan involves tasks focused on identifying data availability, gaps, and challenges in representing water management infrastructure and water use in the hydrofabric for coupling WMMs and hydrologic models. These tasks include data review, developing methods for extending the hydrofabric, and creating software packages and workflows for processing data for the WMMs. The project will test the model coupling using the enhanced hydrofabric in one or two selected managed watersheds. The project's outcomes are expected to improve water forecasting in managed watersheds by integrating human effects into the modeling system. It will result in an extended hydrofabric and tools for coupling WMMs with the EC hydrologic models, aiding water resource assessment and supply forecasting in managed watersheds. This is critical for effective water resource management, particularly under changing climatic conditions.
