We are looking for one post-doctoral scholar interested in ML/AI application in hydrology starting in Summer or Fall 2025. 

---

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Utah State University (USU) is seeking one post-doctoral scholars to work on a new project funded by the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH). These positions are funded for ~20 months with the possibility of extension based on satisfactory performance. The preferred start date is **Summer 2025**, but the positions will remain open until filled.

**Project Description:**

Groundwaterâ€™s contribution to streams in the form of low flows is critical to sustaining streamflow during prolonged dry periods. The primary objective of the project is to **improve the low flow predictions in the NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework through improved subsurface parameterization using big data analysis and ML/AI approaches**. 

**Qualifications:**

- PhD degree in Earth Science (such as hydrology, hydrogeology, geoscience, and environmental science) or other related engineering field (e.g., Civil and Environmental Engineering) at the time the program begins.
- Knowledge of fundamental hydrological processes in the subsurface. Prior knowledge of groundwater hydrology is preferred.
- Expertise in Big Data, machine learning, and/or hydrologic modeling.
- Strong programming skills (e.g., Python and R).
- Strong written and verbal communication skills.
- U.S. work eligibility is required; non-U.S. scholars must have or be able to obtain a visa.

**To Apply:**

If interested, please send an email to Dr. Pin Shuai (pin.shuai@usu.edu) with a **CV, names and contact information for three references, and a Cover Letter**. In your cover letter, please briefly explain how your background aligns with the project. More information about the PI and the research group is available here (https://groundwater.usu.edu). Applications will be reviewed immediately and will continue until the positions are filled. Candidates who are not contacted within 3 months from their application dates may consider their applications unsuccessful.

**Compensation:**

The annual salary ranges from $60,000 to $70,000, depending on experience and work site (inquire for details). USU offers a competitive benefits package, including a 14.2% retirement plan contribution and comprehensive health insurance. Logan, UT, is a charming small college town with affordable cost of living and abundant outdoor recreation opportunities. Logan is just 1.5 hours drive from Salt Lake City.
