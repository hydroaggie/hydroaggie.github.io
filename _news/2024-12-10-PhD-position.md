We are looking for one PhD student interested in computational hydrology starting in **Fall 2025**. 

---

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Utah State University (USU) invites applications for a fully funded Ph.D. position (Research Assistantship) focused on **groundwater-surface water interactions, watershed hydrology, process-based hydrologic modeling, and the application of AI/ML techniques**. The prospective PhD student will have the opportunity to investigate integrated hydrological processes at scales ranging from river reaches to entire watersheds, employing computational approaches such as numerical modeling and machine learning. This is a fully-funded position (i.e., Research Assistantship) and will remain open until filled. The student is expected to start in **Fall 2025**.


**Qualifications:**

- MS or BS degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering or other closely related fields (such as hydrology, geoscience, and environmental science) at the time the Ph.D. program begins.
- Strong quantitative skills with prior experience in hydrologic modeling (e.g., process-based models) and/or machine learning. 
- Proficiency in programming languages (e.g., Python, R) is preferred
- Strong written and verbal communication skills.

**To Apply:**

If interested, please send an email to Dr. Pin Shuai (pin.shuai@usu.edu) with **a CV, unofficial transcripts, and a one-page research statement** outlining your research interests and experiences. More information about the PI and the research group is available here (https://groundwater.usu.edu). While there is no formal application deadline, submitting your application before **March 1, 2025**, is strongly encouraged.

Instructions on how to apply are available at the School of Graduate Studies (https://gradschool.usu.edu/apply/). Specifically, **the GRE test is recommended but not required for all applicants**. An English Proficiency test (TOEFL or IELTS) may be required for international students. Additional information about Utah State University (https://www.usu.edu/) and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/) can be found online.
